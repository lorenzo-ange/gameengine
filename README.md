# C++/SDL2/OpenGL Game Engine

This project is a C++/SDL2/OpenGL custom game engine heavily inspired by the Java/OpenGL game engine built by [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix) in his really great [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP).

## Docs
In the /docs folder you can find some details about the engine features in Italian language.

## Compilation and execution

CMake v 3.0.0 or newer is required.

CMake is responsible to generate the project Makefile and let this app be 100% cross-platform.

Go to the main project folder and then:
```
cd build
cmake ..
make
./gameengine
```
